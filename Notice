  Franz Lisp is distributed as a large shell script which, when run, will
create all necessary directories and place files in those directories.
Only source files are distributed thus this shell script should be able
to pass through any networks unaltered.

 The shell script is broken up in to a set of files named: opusVV.SS
where VV is the version number and SS is a sequence number (aa, ab, ...).
Each file is less than 200,000 bytes.  You can determine what the current
names are by using the FTP 'list directory' command after you log in.

 After you retrieve all the files you should type
	cat opus* | sh
and the distribution will be extracted in the current directory.
You may then remove the opus* files.  
 
  The file ReadMe in the current directory will then describe how to make
the lisp system.

  The files are stored on the arpanet host ucb-c70.  Log in as 'lispuser'
with password 'xxxxx'. Please do not ftp an files other than the opus*  files.
