A chorus of students
under the direction of
Richard Fateman have contributed to
building 
.Fr
from a mere melody into a full
symphony .
The major contributors to the initial system were
Mike Curry,  John Breedlove and Jeff Levinsky.
Bill Rowan added the garbage collector and array package.
Tom London worked on an early compiler and helped in 
overall system design.
Keith Sklower has contributed much to 
.Fr ,
adding the 
bignum package and rewriting most of the code to increase
its efficiency and clarity.
Kipp Hickman and Charles Koester added hunks.
Mitch Marcus added *rset, evalhook and evalframe.
Don Cohen and others at Carnegie-Mellon 
made some improvements to evalframe and 
provided various features modelled after UCI/CMU PDP-10 Lisp and
Interlisp environments (editor, debugger, top-level).
John Foderaro wrote the compiler, added a few functions,
and wrote much of this manual. Of course, other authors have
contributed specific chapters as indicated.
Kevin Layer modified the compiler to produce code for the
Motorola 68000, and helped make
.Fr
pass ``Lint''.
.br
This manual may be supplemented or supplanted by local
chapters representing alterations, additions and deletions.
We at U.C. Berkeley are pleased to learn of generally
useful system features, bug fixes, or useful program packages,
and we will attempt to redistribute such contributions.
