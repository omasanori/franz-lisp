pearl \- P\s-2EARL\s0 AI programming language
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pearl
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pearl
is an AI programming language built on top of F\s-2RANZ\s0\ L\s-2ISP\s0.
P\s-2EARL\s0 (Package for Efficient Access to Representations in Lisp)
was developed with space and time efficiencies in mind.
In addition to providing the usual AI facilities such as slot-filler
objects, demons and associative data bases,
P\s-2EARL\s0 introduces stronger typing on slots,
user-assisted hashing mechanisms,
and a forest of data bases.

There are too many functions to list here; one should refer to the

.SH AUTHORS
P\s-2EARL\s0 was implemented at Berkeley by Joseph Faletti and Michael Deering
under the direction of Robert Wilensky.
P\s-2EARL\s0 was originally implemented under UCILisp on a DEC 2040, moved
without modification to a PDP 10 under TOPS 10, and then (with
significant modification) to a VAX 11/780 under F\s-2RANZ\s0\ L\s-2ISP\s0.
